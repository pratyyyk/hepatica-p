Reusable UI building blocks.

Key components:
- `AppShell.tsx`: sidebar + topbar + auth guard
- `ui.tsx`: Card/Button/Field primitives (simple and style-driven)
- `Timeline.tsx`: timeline visualization + inline status

Reason: primitives keep pages small and encourage consistent interaction patterns.
