# Docs Index

This folder contains cross-cutting documentation that ties the repo together.

- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`
- API reference (human-readable): `docs/api.md`
- Security model and guardrails: `docs/security.md`
- Operations (local + staging): `docs/operations.md`

Why this exists: we keep folder-level READMEs close to code, and keep system-level "how it all fits" here.
